#Pandas-Challenge

Background
Acting as the new Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. In this capacity, I helped the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task was to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

District Summary

Performed the necessary calculations and then created a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame.

Included the following:
- Total number of unique schools
- Total students
- Total budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary

Performd the necessary calculations and then created a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school.

Included the following:
- School name
- School type
- Total students
- Total school budget
- Per student budget
- Average math score
- Average reading score
- % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
- % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
- % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
